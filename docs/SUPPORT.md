# Support

This repository is limited to specific questions about the project itself. Before engaging in external contact, here go some tips:

- Please make sure to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
- Help us help you! [Talk to a duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
- Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it much easier for us to help.
- Donâ€™t fall for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)

For any subject that you feel it's not fitted (yet) as an issue, you can engage in our [Discussions](https://github.com/brunotacca/poc_cleanarch_springboot_multimodule/discussions), jump in there and lurk, talk to us, and help others. If that is not enough, for general questions and a nice talk refer to the contact channels below:
