## Getting started

`#TODO CHANGE-ME REVIEW-ME`

First of all, you must read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), after that you can decide how you want to
contribute to the project, if you want to contribute with the mobile application or the inertial device you should 
take your time to read and understand comprehensively the [Project Architecture](PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md), however,
if you want just to contribute with custom computing methods, you just need a basic understanding of Dart and to
keep reading this guide. To get started with your environment, read the [installation guide](GET_STARTED.md). 

if you feel ready after those readings, then first and foremost choose or open an issue to work on.

### 1. Issues

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/brunotacca/???CHANGE-ME???/issues/new/choose). There will be some options for you to choose then you can follow the guidelines provided on the template, make sure to read it all, and don't be afraid to send it. If you want to submit new computing methods, open an issue as a feature request.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review and test your own changes to speed up the review process.


### 4. Pull Request

`#TODO CHANGE-ME REVIEW-ME`

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill in the template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. 
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, check out this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
