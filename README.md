# Clean Architecture + SpringBoot + MultiModules

SpringBoot project structured with Clean Architecture enforced by Maven MultiModules with whipped cream (Automated Tests) and a cherry added on top (Code Quality Analysis).

### Proof of Concept:

Simple application (domain complexity) with hard architectural boundaries enforced by maven multimodules following Clean Architectural guidelines using Spring to make DI easy.

- Spring (easy DI setup (Spring IoC))
- SpringBoot (Quick Spring project setup)
- Maven MultiModules (Hard Architectural Boundaries)

**Extras:** This project features automated tests to demonstrate a way to do so in a clean architecture style with enforced boundaries. Since this is not a real world application, the test suit doesn't go further than integration and unit tests.

- JUnit and AssertJ
- Test Containers

**Extras 2:** This project also features automated code quality analysis and automation by using:

- SonarQube
- GitHub Actions
